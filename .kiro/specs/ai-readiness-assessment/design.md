# AI Readiness Assessment Tool - Design Document

## Overview

The AI Readiness Assessment Tool will be built using the Deep Agents framework to create an intelligent, adaptive assessment system. The system will employ multiple specialized sub-agents to handle different aspects of the assessment process, from question clarification to personalized recommendation generation. The main agent will orchestrate the overall assessment flow while delegating specialized tasks to sub-agents.

## Architecture

### Main Agent Architecture
The system will use a main orchestrating agent built with the `create_deep_agent` function that coordinates the assessment process and manages the virtual file system for storing assessment data and generating reports.

### Sub-Agent Architecture
The system will employ five specialized sub-agents:

1. **Assessment Guide Agent** - Provides clarifications and explanations for assessment questions
2. **Scoring Agent** - Handles score calculations and validation
3. **Recommendation Agent** - Generates personalized recommendations based on assessment results
4. **Report Generator Agent** - Creates comprehensive assessment reports
5. **Kenya Context Agent** - Provides Kenya-specific business and regulatory context

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Main Agent → Sub-Agents → File System → Report Generation → User Output
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Main Agent
**Purpose:** Orchestrates the assessment process and manages user interaction
**Tools:** All built-in tools (file system, todo management) plus custom assessment tools
**Responsibilities:**
- Guide users through the six assessment sections
- Coordinate with sub-agents for specialized tasks
- Manage assessment state and progress
- Generate final reports and recommendations

### Assessment Guide Agent
**Purpose:** Provides detailed explanations and guidance for assessment questions
**Tools:** Access to assessment content and examples database
**Prompt:** "You are an AI readiness assessment guide specializing in helping Kenyan businesses understand assessment questions. Provide clear, contextual explanations with relevant examples from the Kenyan business environment."

### Scoring Agent  
**Purpose:** Handles all scoring calculations and validation
**Tools:** Mathematical calculation tools and scoring validation functions
**Prompt:** "You are a scoring specialist for AI readiness assessments. Calculate accurate scores, validate responses, and ensure scoring consistency across all assessment sections."

### Recommendation Agent
**Purpose:** Generates personalized recommendations based on assessment results
**Tools:** Access to recommendation templates and best practices database
**Prompt:** "You are an AI strategy consultant specializing in Kenyan businesses. Generate actionable, prioritized recommendations based on assessment results, considering local business context and constraints."

### Report Generator Agent
**Purpose:** Creates comprehensive, professional assessment reports
**Tools:** Report templates and formatting tools
**Prompt:** "You are a professional report writer specializing in AI readiness assessments. Create clear, comprehensive reports with visual elements, actionable insights, and professional formatting."

### Kenya Context Agent
**Purpose:** Provides Kenya-specific business and regulatory context
**Tools:** Access to Kenyan business regulations, market data, and local examples
**Prompt:** "You are a Kenyan business expert with deep knowledge of local regulations, market conditions, and business practices. Provide context-specific guidance for AI adoption in Kenya."

## Data Models

### Assessment State
```python
class AssessmentState:
    user_id: str
    business_name: str
    industry: str
    assessment_sections: Dict[str, SectionScore]
    current_section: int
    total_score: int
    readiness_level: str
    started_at: datetime
    completed_at: Optional[datetime]
    progress: float
```

### Section Score
```python
class SectionScore:
    section_name: str
    questions: Dict[str, int]  # question_id -> score (1-5)
    section_total: int
    max_possible: int
    completion_status: bool
```

### Recommendation
```python
class Recommendation:
    readiness_level: str
    priority_actions: List[str]
    timeline: str
    immediate_actions: List[str]
    short_term_goals: List[str]
    long_term_vision: List[str]
    kenya_specific_notes: List[str]
```

## Error Handling

### Input Validation
- Validate score ranges (1-5) for all assessment questions
- Ensure all required fields are completed before section progression
- Handle incomplete assessments with save/resume functionality

### Sub-Agent Error Handling
- Implement fallback responses if sub-agents are unavailable
- Retry mechanisms for failed sub-agent calls
- Graceful degradation to basic functionality if advanced features fail

### Data Persistence
- Auto-save assessment progress every 5 questions
- Backup assessment data to prevent loss
- Handle concurrent access if multiple users access the same assessment

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual sub-agent responses and accuracy
- Validate scoring calculations and logic
- Test assessment state management and persistence

### Integration Testing
- Test main agent coordination with all sub-agents
- Validate end-to-end assessment flow
- Test report generation with various score combinations

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test with sample Kenyan businesses across different industries
- Validate recommendation accuracy and relevance
- Ensure cultural and contextual appropriateness

### Performance Testing
- Test system response times with multiple concurrent assessments
- Validate sub-agent performance under load
- Test file system operations with large assessment datasets

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Assessment Engine
- Implement main agent with basic assessment flow
- Create assessment guide and scoring sub-agents
- Build basic file system for storing assessment data

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
- Implement recommendation and report generator agents
- Add Kenya context agent for localized guidance
- Enhance main agent with adaptive questioning

### Phase 3: User Experience
- Add progress tracking and save/resume functionality
- Implement visual report generation
- Add assessment analytics and benchmarking

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Add multi-language support (English/Swahili)
- Implement assessment comparison and tracking over time
- Add integration capabilities for business systems
